Hi there, this is @kitbank github page. I hold a PhD degree from Nagoya University (Japan) in 2021. 
My research deals with institutional change with frequent focus on policy analysis.
I am quite well versed on quasi-experimental method and Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) analysis.
Take a look at my JMP if you're interested!

You can drop a message here if you want to reach me.



Thank you for visiting.
